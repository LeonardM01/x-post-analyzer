# x-post-analyzer

Open-source tool for analyzing X/Twitter posts against the real Twitter algorithm.

## Quick Analysis Skill

When asked to analyze a tweet, run:

```bash
node src/cli.js [options] "tweet text here"
```

### Options
- `--image` / `--video` / `--gif` / `--poll` - specify media type
- `--compare "tweet1" "tweet2"` - compare multiple versions
- `-o report.md` - save report to file
- `-f tweets.txt` - read tweets from file

### What to Check (Priority Order)

1. **Reply triggers** - Does the tweet ask a question or provoke discussion? Drives reply_score + dwell_time.
2. **Negative-feedback risk** - No excessive hashtags, caps, mentions, or links. Triggers not_interested/block/mute heads.
3. **Media** (2-2.5x boost) - Does it have an image/video? Images also drive photo_expand_score.
4. **Text quality** (75-200 chars optimal for 3-8s dwell window) - Right length, readable formatting.
5. **External links** (penalized) - Links should go in replies, not main tweet.
6. **Banger likelihood** - Score >= 0.4 threshold. Novelty, hook, no cliche density.

# Dev Team Pack
## Tech Stack

- Node.js (ES modules)
- JavaScript
- No runtime dependencies declared in package.json

## Architecture

Explain folders and patterns.

## Coding Rules

- Use functional React components
- Prefer server components
- Use Tailwind utilities instead of custom CSS
- do not put any comments in!
- only 1 component per file named after the component
- do not use constants for all text, only if there are some arrays, maps or json objects that get used. we do not need text or similar things as a constant

## Design System

- Follow ShadCN patterns

## Commands

`npm run analyze`
`npm test`

The assistant MUST use only the commands listed above for running, building, testing, and linting this project. Do not invoke any other package manager, test runner, or build tool.

# lean-ctx — Context Engineering Layer

PREFER lean-ctx MCP tools over native equivalents for token savings:

| PREFER                      | OVER                     | Why                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ctx_read(path)`            | Read / cat / head / tail | Session caching, 8 compression modes, re-reads cost ~13 tokens |
| `ctx_shell(command)`        | Bash (shell commands)    | Pattern-based compression for git, npm, cargo, docker, tsc     |
| `ctx_search(pattern, path)` | Grep / rg                | Compact context, token-efficient results                       |
| `ctx_tree(path, depth)`     | ls / find                | Compact directory maps with file counts                        |

## ctx_read Modes

- `full` — cached read (use for files you will edit)
- `map` — deps + API signatures (use for context-only files)
- `signatures` — API surface only
- `diff` — changed lines only (after edits)
- `aggressive` — syntax stripped
- `entropy` — Shannon + Jaccard filtering
- `lines:N-M` — specific range

## File Editing

Use native Edit/StrReplace when available. If Edit requires Read and Read is unavailable,
use `ctx_edit(path, old_string, new_string)` — it reads, replaces, and writes in one MCP call.
NEVER loop trying to make Edit work. If it fails, switch to ctx_edit immediately.
Write, Delete have no lean-ctx equivalent — use them normally.
