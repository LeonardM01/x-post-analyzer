Trigger whenever the user says "start jira ticket", "work on <KEY-123>", "kick off a ticket", "new ticket", or supplies a Jira issue key and asks Claude to begin work. Supports running in parallel across multiple tickets via separate worktrees.

# jira-start

Kick off work on a Jira ticket in an isolated worktree and delegate to the code-architect agent (Albus).

## Preconditions

Check before doing anything else. If any fail, stop and tell the user.

1. **Atlassian MCP authenticated.** Atlassian MCP tools must be callable. If not connected, tell the user to run `/mcp` and authenticate the Atlassian server, then re-run the skill.
2. **Target repo is a git repo.** `git -C <repo> rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` must succeed.
3. **Working tree of the main checkout is clean-ish.** Warn (don't block) on uncommitted changes in the main checkout; worktrees are independent so this is informational.

## Step 1 — Collect inputs

Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask for:

1. **Jira ticket key** (e.g. `PROJ-123`). Free text. Validate format `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+-\d+$`.
2. **Target repo absolute path**. Free text. Default to the current working directory if it's a git repo.

Do not guess — always ask, even if a key appears elsewhere in context.

## Step 2 — Fetch ticket data via Atlassian MCP

Call the Atlassian MCP tool(s) to retrieve the issue. Gather:

- Summary, description (full, not truncated), status, priority, issue type
- Labels, components, fix versions
- Assignee, reporter, created/updated timestamps
- Acceptance criteria field (custom field — look for `customfield_*` labeled "Acceptance Criteria" or similar)
- Attachments: list filenames and URLs (do not download unless needed)
- Linked issues and sub-tasks (key + summary + link type)
- Most recent ~10 comments (author, created, body)
- Canonical Jira URL

If the ticket does not exist or the MCP call fails, abort with the error message.

## Step 3 — Normalize into a brief

Render the fetched data into `<repo>/.worktrees/<TICKET>/.jira-brief.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# <TICKET>: <Summary>

- **Status:** ...
- **Priority:** ... | **Type:** ...
- **Assignee:** ... | **Reporter:** ...
- **Labels:** ... | **Components:** ...
- **Jira:** <url>

## Description
<full description, markdown-converted from ADF if needed>

## Acceptance Criteria
<bullet list or "not specified">

## Linked Issues / Sub-tasks
- <KEY> (<link type>): <summary>

## Attachments
- <filename> — <url>

## Recent Comments
### <author> — <date>
<body>
...
```

(Write this file AFTER the worktree exists — see Step 4.)

## Step 4 — Create the worktree

1. Ensure `.worktrees/` is ignored: read `<repo>/.gitignore`; if `.worktrees/` is not present, append it on its own line. If `.gitignore` doesn't exist, create it with that single line.
2. Derive the branch name: use the ticket key verbatim (e.g. `PROJ-123`). If the repo uses lowercase branch conventions (check recent branches via `git -C <repo> branch --format='%(refname:short)' | head -20`), lowercase it.
3. Run: `git -C <repo> worktree add .worktrees/<TICKET> -b <branch>`.
4. If the branch already exists, ask the user via `AskUserQuestion` whether to (a) reuse it (`git worktree add .worktrees/<TICKET> <branch>` without `-b`), (b) replace it, or (c) abort.
5. If `.worktrees/<TICKET>` already exists as a worktree, ask whether to reuse it, remove+recreate, or abort.
6. Now write the brief file from Step 3 into the worktree.

## Step 5 — Delegate to code-architect (Albus)

Invoke the agent via the `Agent` tool:

- `subagent_type: "code-architect"`
- `description`: "Kick off <TICKET>: <short summary>"
- `prompt`: include the full `.jira-brief.md` contents inline, the worktree absolute path, the Jira URL, and an explicit instruction: "Treat `<worktree path>` as your working directory. Follow your normal chain: analyze patterns, design the architecture, delegate implementation to the fullstack-developer (Harry), then hand off to code-reviewer and docs-maintainer as appropriate. Do not modify files outside the worktree."
- Do NOT pass `isolation: worktree` — the worktree we created IS the isolation.

## Step 6 — Report back to the user

Output a short summary:

- Ticket: `<KEY>` — `<summary>` (`<jira url>`)
- Worktree: `<absolute path>`
- Branch: `<branch>`
- Brief: `<worktree>/.jira-brief.md`
- Architect: kicked off (or: finished / handed off to …)

Tell the user they can open a separate Claude session with `cwd=<worktree>` to continue work in parallel with other tickets.

## Guardrails

- **Do not start coding yourself.** Your job is Jira fetch → worktree → delegate. Implementation is Albus's chain.
- **Do not edit anything outside `<repo>/.gitignore` and `<worktree>/.jira-brief.md`** during the skill run.
- **Do not download attachments** unless the architect later asks for them.
- **Never reuse a dirty worktree silently** — always prompt.

## Parallel tickets

This skill makes no assumption of a single active ticket. Each run produces an independent `.worktrees/<KEY>` on its own branch. Run it as many times as needed; open each worktree in its own Claude session to work on tickets concurrently.
